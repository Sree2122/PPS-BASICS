This repository contains basic C programs that are commonly used in Problem Solving and Programming (PPS) courses. These programs cover fundamental concepts like input/output, loops, conditionals, and number manipulations.

List of Programs
Hello World

The simplest C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
Demonstrates the basic structure of a C program with printf().
Sum of Two Numbers

Accepts two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum.
Uses scanf() to take input and printf() to display the output.
Check Even or Odd

Takes an integer input from the user and determines if it is even or odd.
Uses the modulus operator % to check divisibility by 2.
Find the Largest Number

Compares three integer inputs and determines the largest among them.
Implements conditional statements (if-else) for decision-making.
Factorial of a Number

Computes the factorial of a given number using a loop.
Uses a for loop to multiply numbers from 1 to n.
Fibonacci Series

Generates the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms.
Uses a loop to calculate and display the series iteratively.
Reverse a Number

Takes an integer input and reverses its digits.
Uses loops and the modulus operator % to extract digits and reconstruct the number in reverse order
